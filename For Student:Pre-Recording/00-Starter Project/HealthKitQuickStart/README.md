#  HealthKit Quick Start Screencast

**This screencast was based, in part, on the HealthKit Tutorial With Swift by Ted Bendixson - if you like what you've seen here, please be sure to check out the tutorial, and follow him on twitter @bendixso**

## Sample Project Idea
A raywenderlich.com Virtual WaterCooler app that tracks how often you get up from your desk, walk around, and refill your water bottle throughout the day.  Users can enter the amount of water consumed, and the app reads how many steps you have gone and flights climbed from the HealthKit data store.  Other user profile information (height, weight, etc) is read in from HealthKit and shown in a profile page.

## Main Topics
* Privacy Settings
* Reading static data (e.g. user profile data)
* Writing a new sample (e.g. water consumed)
* Querying data statistics (e.g. getting sum of all water consumed today)
